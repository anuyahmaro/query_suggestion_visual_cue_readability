# Visual Cues to Guide Query Formulation

With the aim to help children in formulating effective queries, I implemented a search interface that integrates a visual cue "reading comprehension scores" for presenting query suggestions to them.

Programming and scripting languages used for the design includes: Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.
